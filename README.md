<h1>Simple Status</h1>

<p>A minimalistic standalone script for posting and viewing statuses in 140 character social-network-style. It was originally developed for the private community <a href="http://theqbee.net" title="The Quilting Bee">The Quilting Bee</a> and made to support multiple users and other features such as replying, hash tags, cross-posting to Twitter and Facebook, and much more. What you see here is very bare bones, but additional features will be released as they are cleaned up for public use! :D</p>
